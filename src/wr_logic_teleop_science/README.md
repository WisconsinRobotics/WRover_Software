This package is a deprecated, ideolized software system for the high-level logic of controlling the Science Box.  

## Controls Layout

* POV hat: x-y axis control over a gantry with a soil collection claw on it  
* Right Stick Y Axis: "claw" control  
* Left/Right Shoulder Keys: Index left/right on the turntable through a PID controller  

### Controls Note

This control scheme is ideolized and deprecated due to having no matching hardware implmentation.  Talk to the science team members to get a better idea for what they're current goals are, what hardware they want to use, and the timeline they have in mind.
