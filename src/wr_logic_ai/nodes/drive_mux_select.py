@brief Node for switching between long-range navigation output and short-range navigation output to 
rover motor power inputs
@details In the world of computer engineering, MUX is short for multiplexer. A multiplexer is a logic 
circuit that takes in multiple input signals, chooses one among them, and output that signal.

Here, the mux select node performs a similar function by choosing a motor power output between 
long-range logics and short-range logics and forwards it to the actual motor power topic. The 
switching behavior is controlled by which state the state machine is currently in. The purpose of 
doing this extra step is to add a layer of virtualization between higher level logics and low level 
controls. Both long range and short range believes that they have complete control over the rover, 
thereby simplifying their implementations.
