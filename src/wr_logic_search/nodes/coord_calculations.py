    Description: 'Main' method that gets the coordinates the rover will travel to in the current 
        searching round based on the parameters. We only need to call this method.

    Parameter(s): 
        start_lat - the rover's starting latitude in the current searching round
        start_long - the rover's starting longitude in the current searching round
        distance - the distance traveled between the starting coordinate and the next 
                   immediate coordinate
        num_vertices - the maximum number of coordinates the rover could travel to

def calc_dest_coord(curr_lat, curr_long, distance, bearing) -> dict:
    '''
    Description: Calculates the target latitude and longitude for each cardinal direction 
        based on the current latitude and longitude, distance, and bearing.

    The formula 'Destination point given distance and bearing from start point' from 
    https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html. Based on these formulas, north 
    has a bearing of 0°, east has a bearing of 90°, south has a bearing of 180°, 
    and west has a bearing of 270°. 
        
    With the variables curr_lat, curr_long, distance, bearing, and EARTH_RADIUS, 
        target_lat and target_long can be calculated using these formulas:
        
        target_lat = asin(
            sin(curr_lat) 
            ⋅ cos(distance / EARTH_RADIUS) 
            + cos(curr_lat) 
            ⋅ sin(distance / EARTH_RADIUS) 
            ⋅ cos(bearing))
        
        target_long = curr_long + atan2(
            sin(bearing) 
            ⋅ sin(distance / EARTH_RADIUS) 
            ⋅ cos(curr_lat), 
            cos(distance / EARTH_RADIUS) 
            − sin(curr_lat)^2))

    Parameter(s):
        curr_lat - the current latitude in degrees
        curr_long - the current longitude in degrees
        distance - the distance that will be traveled
        bearing - the bearing/direction that will be traveled toward

    Return(s):
        coord - the newly calculated coordinate, containing:
            target_lat - the newly calculated target latitude in degrees
            target_long - the newly calculated target longitude in degrees
            (what it took to get to the target latitude and longitude)
            distance - the distance that was traveled
            bearing - the bearing/direction that was traveled toward
