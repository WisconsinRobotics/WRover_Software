# wroboarm_23

@defgroup wroboarm_23 wroboarm_23

This package contains the model of the robotic arm on the front of the WRover, as well as the required information for MoveIt to perform IK on the arm.  

## Editing

### The package

This package is (mostly) autogenerated by the `moveit_setup_assistant`.  If this package must be edited in a non-trivial way, then use the `moveit_setup_assistant` again on the package; it will allow you to edit the existing configuration.

To run `moveit_setup_assistant`, run `$(roscore & rosrun moveit_setup_assistant moveit_setup_assistant)` in `bash`

### The model

The model relies on an exported URDF definition of the arm.  This is generated via a plugin to Solidworks, which is provided on CoE lab machines.  

For the export, to avoid load on the IK system while maintaining simulation integrity, use actual parts of the arm (plates, motors, structural components), but exclude small components that do not significantly affect the work area (like nuts, bolts).

The `config` folder has configuration parameters not known to the model itself, like joint limits.

## Launching

The `demo.launch` file is autogenerated, and `demo_test.launch` is a slightly modified version of that file made to launch correctly across the WRover system.  In a competition system, you probably want to use `demo_test.launch`.
